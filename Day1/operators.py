#1. Arithemetic operators
#2. Relational / comparison operators
#3. Membership Operators
#4.Identitity Operators
#5. Assignment Operators
#6. floor division(//)
a=5
print(a/2)==2

a=5
print(a**2)

#identity operators ('is' and 'is not')
a=1
b=1
print(a==b)#true
print(a is b) #true, value of a and b are in the same memory location
print(a is b) #false. here a and b are tow different objects

#assignment operator (=,=+,-=,/=...)


#precedemce and associativity
#precedence is the rule which defines which operation to execute first
a=2+5/5 #precedence of / is greater than +

#if two operatior have the same precedence then associativity is taken into consideration
#associativity in pyton alwayys goes from left to right
a=2*3/3 #6


#identifiers => all those names which are given by the user while coding are the identifiers
#for example => variables,function name, class name, module name

#rules for naming identifers
#1. It is case sensitive
a=1
A=2

#2. identifiers can't be keywords
#identifiers cant contain special symbols (@#$%^)
